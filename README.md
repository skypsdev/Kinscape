To trigger deployment manually:

* setup Heroku remotes:

      git remote add staging git@heroku.com:kinscape-staging.git
      git remote add production git@heroku.com:kinscape-production.git


* deploy to `staging`:

    Create Pull Request to initiate code review cycle:

    When approved- Merge pull request or in less common situations when you need to manually push branch directly:

      git push staging <branch_name>:master

* deploy to `production`:

      git push production <branch_name>:master

Review applications
